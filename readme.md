# EducaSwitch Challenge

It is a React Native project, some features where add on this project to show it as result.

The project will check a list of user where you can use the searchbar to find a specific user. The project has a Drawer where you can go to Home Screen and About Screen. The project's style is took from ```react-native-paper``` dependency.

To make the project run (Actually the first thing is clone or download the project) first you have to install all the dependencies to make the project run properly. This project I used **Expo** and I installed the dependencies with **Yarn**

Command for dependencies installation

```
yarn install
```

Once you done with this part, the next thing to do is run the project. You have three option.

- If you are using mac and have Xcode installed you can run this command and see how the project looks on IOs Simulator. Command
```
yarn ios
```
- If you prefer run the project on Android simulator (If you have all the requirements to make run this project on Android) you can use this command
```
yarn android
```
- The third option you can use is to run the project on web the command would be this: 
```
yarn web
```

The user info to show on the project it's from [RandomUser.me](https://randomuser.me/)

Any doubt or any trouble to make the project works please let me know, I will glad to help.
